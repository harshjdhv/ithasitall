## What is ithasitall?

ithasitall is a collection of small, essential developer tools that run **entirely in your browser**.

No backend. No accounts. No tracking.
Just tools that work.

---

## Why it exists

Developers constantly need quick utilities:

* format JSON
* decode tokens
* generate IDs
* convert data

Most solutions are slow, noisy, or untrustworthy.

ithasitall aims to be the opposite — **quiet, fast, and reliable**.

---

## Core principles

* **Client-side only** — everything runs locally
* **Privacy-first** — nothing leaves your machine
* **Tool-first UX** — no landing pages, no fluff
* **Minimal & premium** — design stays out of the way

---

## Status

This project is in early development.

The focus right now is:

* building a solid foundation
* defining strict UI and UX rules
* shipping small tools consistently

---

## Tech (early)

* Next.js
* React
* TypeScript
* Tailwind CSS

---

## Philosophy

ithasitall is intentionally opinionated.

It is not trying to impress.
It is trying to be useful.
